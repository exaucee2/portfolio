                <p>Hi,I'm a student pursuing an Honours degree in Computer Science,
                    passionate about emerging technologies and their impact on our daily lives.
                    Through out my studies, I have developed a strong expertise in programming,
                    data analysis and computer systems. I'm particularly interested in web development and data analysis,
                    and have had the opportunity to work on several academic projects applying my knowledge.
                    I'm constantly on the look out for new trends, and am actively seeking internship or project opportunities
                    that will enable me to deepen my skills and add value to a team. My curiosity and eagerness to learn make me a motivated and enthusiastic person, 
                    ready to take on new challenges in the IT field.
                </p>
